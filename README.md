# ⚾ Baseball Draft Tracker - Collaboration Setup

## 🌐 Two Ways to Collaborate

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free & Easy)
I'll create a free web version that both of you can access from anywhere.

**What you get:**
- 🌐 Free web dashboard for both users
- 🔄 Real-time sync between users
- 📱 Works on any device (phone, tablet, computer)
- 📊 Live activity tracking
- 💾 Data export/import functionality

### Option 2: Local Dashboard (Current Setup)
Keep using the local version you already have.

**What you get:**
- 📋 Only works on your computer
- 🔒 Data stays local and private
- 🚀 No setup needed
