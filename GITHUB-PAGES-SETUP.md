2. **Open the web dashboard** - Use the live URL for quick access
3. **Real-time sync** - Changes sync between local and web automatically

### For Your Co-Owner:
1. **Share this URL**: `https://[your-username].github.io/baseball-draft-tracker/?user=CoOwner`
2. **Add "?user=CoOwner"** to the end so you both have unique IDs
3. **Full access** - Can add players, draft, export data, etc.

### Example URLs:

Your URL: https://[username].github.io/baseball-draft-tracker/?user=User1
Co-owner URL: https://[username].github.io/baseball-draft-tracker/?user=User2
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
- **GitHub Pages**: Takes 1-2 minutes to activate after setup
